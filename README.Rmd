## Markdown vs. R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. R Markdown uses the Markdown language, but allows for the addition of authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents with functional code snippets and actual outputs from within the RStudio IDE.

* For RStudio see <https://rstudio.com/>.
* For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

## Converting from `README.Rmd` â†’ `README.md`

You can clone this repository as a template for your own feature-rich `README.md` files on GitHub.

If you open the `README.Rmd` document for editing in RStudio and click the **Knit** button, a normal Markdown document (`README.md`) will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document.

## Code and output

You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r chunk_id_cars}
summary(cars)
```

> `cars` is one of many default example data sets in the R language.

## Images

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r chunk_id_pressure}
plot(pressure)
```

> The output image from this code execution will be automatically saved in the `.img` subdirectory.
